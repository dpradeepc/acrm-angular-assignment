# Notes
1) I have not implemented the part which says combine the results, I am not able to see the instructions as I am taken to the second page, this should be very simple to implement based on the usecase we are solving.
2) There are lot of minor enhancements we can do, the most obvious is the styling which includes positioning, alignment and fixed containers for listing and pagination, there should be a loader while fetching records.
3) I have not used any component library so it should be pretty straightforward to run the code, just npm install it.
